## Scene Promotion

When you publish a scene to Hubs, you agree to abide by the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/blob/master/TERMS.md). As part of publishing your scene, you can choose to indicate if Mozilla may promote your scene. Promoted scenes may be shared from our social media accounts, marketing materials, landing pages, included in search results, or be surfaced through other channels for discovery. If your scene is not allowed to be promoted, then the link to your scene page will need to be shared directly with the people who wish to use it.
